# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 2 - New files and directories:

### New directory: images, containing images to be used by model:

        nothing.jpg
        paper_1.jpg
        paper_2.jpg
        paper_3.jpg
        rock_1.JPG
        rock_2.jpg
        rock_3.jpg
        scissors_1.jpg
        scissors_2.jpg
        scissors_3.jpg

### New files:

        keras_model.h5 - the model generated from Teachable Machine
        labels.txt - the names of the classes

### Experience so far

Being completely new to all this, I find it intriguing.
The model will clearly be used to interpret images in the game, but, I have no idea how it will do this.
The code can be executed from a Python script, so, I look forward to writing it.

### Modification:

Previous push used images, as I did not have a webcam.
Now that I have one, I have take pictures from it and removed the images.
